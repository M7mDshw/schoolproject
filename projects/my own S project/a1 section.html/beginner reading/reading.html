        Once upon a time there was a boy named Sal. He was living a happy life with his family . They moved to Ohio , then he asked his father if he can go outside to make some friend , then his father accepted.Then he went out to meet new people in his apartment after that he met with 3 nice kids. <br> Their names were Harry , Mary and Saul respectively  . After they went out to play some games in the park . They started to get on well with each other . While they were playing they saw an injured cat in the road . They ran to pick it up . Then they brought to vet. Vet said the cat is going to be fine . Then they got happy and while they were on the way to the home they saw a poster of a missing cat. They realised the image of the cat was same with the cat that they found in the road . They brought the cat to its owner and the owner gave them some money. They bought 3 ice creams for themselves and they had a good day. <br><br>
